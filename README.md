# Student-Performance-Prediction-using-Linear-Regression
This project implements a simple linear regression model using gradient descent to predict a Performance Index based on various student features such as study hours, previous scores, sleep, and more. The training process includes feature normalization and evaluates the model using the coefficient of determination (RÂ²).
